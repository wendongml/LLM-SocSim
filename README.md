SocSim is an open-source simulation framework that models large-scale social networks and user behavior. Built on agent-based modeling principles, it leverages cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) to power realistic agent interactions, enabling researchers to explore issues such as echo chambers, polarization, and misinformation. Through generative embeddings, collaborative filtering, and policy-driven regularization, SocSim provides a sandbox for designing, testing, and evaluating interventions that promote ethical and inclusive online discourse. It supports researchers, platform developers, and policymakers in analyzing how diverse recommendation algorithms, moderation strategies, and user education tools impact social cohesion, bias, and overall engagement on societal-scale platforms like Reddit.

> **Key features**  
> - **LLM-Enhanced Agents:** Agents use retrieval-augmented generation and fine-grained embeddings to generate lifelike content and conversation patterns.  
> - **Scalable Social Simulation:** Processes large datasets and simulates millions of users across multiple sub-communities.  
> - **Policy Interventions:** Offers customizable modules to evaluate scenarios such as filter-bubble disruption, bias mitigation, and content moderation.  
> - **Ethical & Transparent:** Emphasizes interpretability, responsible AI guidelines, and reproducible workflows to inform evidence-based policy decisions.
